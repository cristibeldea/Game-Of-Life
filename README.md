# Game-Of-Life
This is a desktop version of John Conway's Game of Life

# The MAIN Class file is named GameOfLife.java

# The Rules of the game:
The game starts fresh with an empty grid of "dead" pixels. By simply clicking a pixel, it turns yellow, therefore becoming alive.
You can setup the grid in any fashion you like.
After the user presses the "START" button, he can no longer intervene in the evolution of the "population"
The population evolves by the following rules:
  1) Any alive pixel that has less than 2 neighbors will die of solitude
  2) Any alive pixel that has 2 or 3 neighbors will survive
  3) Any alive pixel that has 4 or more neighbors dies of overpopulation
  4) Any dead pixel having exactly 3 neighbors, becomes alive

This is process is repeated continuously.
The neighbors are any squares to the left, right, up, down or any of the corners of the current square
The repository also contains a video of a working example of how the game runs.
